## An Important Note About Support

Addonis (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine odds and sods) is not supported.

Have a nose through the source code, and feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use Addonis, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have it installed locally any more.

## Overview

ExpressionEngine 2 package and datatype builder, cobbled together in CodeIgniter.
